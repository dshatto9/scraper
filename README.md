# scraper

This program is a web scraper that I built with Python and Beautiful Soup for seeing the top votes on Hacker News. It sorts out articles by upvotes of over 100 with the links and title. I opted for Hacker News because their rules on scraping are pretty lenient and offered the best results. I made sure to check the robots.txt file before writing any code.
